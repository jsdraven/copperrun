ToDo List

 (done) 1) Fix sorting of times cannot trust natural sort. may want to do a pop to end of array. 
    (convert time stamp into seconds then sort seconds with natural sort. will need two functions, convert time to seconds and convert seconds to time readable)
 2) Set multiple tables for results. using MySQL records, ID A.I. and year. I will need to generate form to remove bad records and add intended records. AKA HDTV Output
 ?what crack is this? 3) create a preemptive form for tracking order of incoming bib numbers.

4) create user's search system
	a) We will accept first name last name and bib number. Only force at least one item any one of them.
	b) land on a table of results unless there is only one to return then go strait to result.
	c) result table will only list first name, and bib. Age and all other info will not be public
	d) create mobile friendly info page.
	e) racer placement results will include place with total 5 other racers first names. 2 ahead and 2 behind or 3 behind is in first and second.
	f) may need to create a result page that defines the url for the feed.php to use. this will allow me to create a list of optional results if they do a partial name or bib number.
	g) look into dynamic search field propagation for easier mobile device search technique.

5) Live result TV feed.
	a) page layout
	b) build it so I could use a configuration file for age ranges and race type.
	c) Track time stamp every 30 switch viewed race. Must have different color for background so at a glance see what race it is you are looking at.
 
6) build the input forms with more protection for noob assisted entries.

7) build report methods for my use only.

8) TV feed control options in the admin panel for what race set to show. Need to revise the admin panel so that there could be one controlling admin but two or more data entry.
